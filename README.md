# Reign 0.1
Minecraft modpack

"We survived the apocalypse... but that was only the beginning."

The time is 1 000 years from the day the world came to an end.
The one they called Messiah is gone but His priests and hordes of undead remain.

They called the rapture "the great cleansing". Nobody knows how many survived the famine, the fires, the storms and the riots
but those who did would soon wish that they too had fallen. 

Some say the Messiah came from the sky, riding on a horse so big that the distance between its ears stretched for miles.
Others say he came in a house, falling from the sky in a burning flash brighter than the sun.
One thing they all say is that the noise was so loud that it deafened the ears of all who witnessed His coming.
With no one able to teach the little ones to talk, those who remained on the surface lost the spoken language of their ancestors. 
All that remained were the writings. We have been told to look for these.

The Elders did not say much more; only that we had been undead, and that those who are still undead would come for us. They said
all would be revealed in time, but for now we must strive to Reclaim. Rebuild. and Reign.

Reign is an advanced survival and tech progression sandbox world. The progression centres on a modified version of Ancient Warfare 2 but incorporates multiple tech mods as well. Building a fort in Minecraft is no longer merely an artistic pursuit. Players must strive to defend their base and their NPCs from multiple attacks, including raids from enhanced mobs that are able to breach defenses, and even from rival armies.

You are not alone, however. Ancient Warfare 2 provides you with soldiers, farmers, lumberjacks, miners, couriers, traders and more. You will have to keep them housed, fed and protected as you strive to expand your reign.

Your first day in Reign will be a race against the sun. Reign utilises a mod that doubles the Minecraft day length. You will need it. The extended day length in Minecraft encourages exploration in a world where you *must* be home before dark. You cannot simply plop your bed down anywhere when it gets dark. Beds must be placed for a full Minecraft day before they can be slept in. Use your first day to collect the resources needed for light, food and shelter. 

Warning: Do not punch the trees. It hurts. Find some gravel and craft yourself a flint handaxe. Now you can fell a tree (beware of falling logs!). You will most likely need to make a campfire on the first night. For this you will need sticks (break leaves with an empty hand) and your flint handaxe. Any small game you've hunted with your handaxe can be cooked on the campfire as it provides you with much-needed light and warmth. You will need plenty of sticks to keep the campfire fueled through the long night.

By morning, you should have made your first flint Tinkers tools and mined enough rock to make a furnace. You can now make torches, but beware - they will go out. They will also be targeted by mobs (as will all early-game light sources like candles, Railcraft lanterns, etc). You will need to wall off safe areas, both underground as you mine and above ground, too. Watch out for sneaky zombies throwing their friends over fences to reach you. It is possible to be wiped out very quickly this way. 

Protect your inner sanctum - your bed - at all costs. Multiple deaths are a crippling blow in Reign. If you're used to death in Minecraft as an alternative to eating, you will quickly learn that that won't work here. It takes time to rebuild your strength after a death - but then death was never meant to be a means of survival. Stay fed. Don't jump. Sprint only when you have to.

The inclusion of Iguana Tweaks means you will need to make use of rails, couriers and other transportation where possible. Choose wisely what you carry. Every expendition will have to be planned, but there is much to be gained by exploring. Dungeons, ruins and strange villages hold secrets to your success. Even the flowers hold clues for the wise traveller.
