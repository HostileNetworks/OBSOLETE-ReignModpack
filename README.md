# Reign 0.1

Minecraft modpack. The following document is a work in progress.

"We survived the apocalypse... but that was only the beginning."

The time is 1 000 years from the day the world came to an end.
The one they called Messiah is gone but His priests and hordes of undead remain.

They called the rapture "the great cleansing". Nobody knows how many survived the famine, the fires, the storms and the riots
but those who did would soon wish that they too had fallen. 

Some say the Messiah came from the sky, riding on a horse so big that the distance between its ears stretched for miles.
Others say he came in a house, falling from the sky in a burning flash brighter than the sun.
One thing they all say is that the noise was so loud that it deafened the ears of all who witnessed His coming.
With no one able to teach the little ones to talk, those who remained on the surface lost the spoken language of their ancestors. 
All that remained were the writings. We have been told to look for these.

The Elders did not say much more; only that we had been undead, and that those who are still undead would come for us. They said
all would be revealed in time, but for now we must strive to Reclaim. Rebuild. and Reign.

Reign is an advanced survival and tech progression sandbox world. The progression centres on a modified version of Ancient Warfare 2 but incorporates multiple tech mods as well. Building a fort in Minecraft is no longer merely an artistic pursuit. Players must strive to defend their base and their NPCs from multiple attacks, including raids from enhanced mobs that are able to breach defenses, and even from rival armies.

You are not alone, however. Ancient Warfare 2 provides you with soldiers, farmers, lumberjacks, miners, couriers, traders and more. You will have to keep them housed, fed and protected as you strive to expand your reign.

@Dulciphi (myself), who has been working on this pack since the "Dulcified in a Hostile World" Journal and server.
@Reteo, who's inspiration, productivity and professionalism taught me so much
@Haggle, who's Revolution pack I was introduced to through Dan when he wanted to show me how Reika's tech mods *could* work in a modpack with other tech mods. 
and @Reika, I'd long been inspired by Reika's work and dreamed of developing an integrated modpack that could be deployed in classrooms to teach concepts of maths, physics and enginnering, using the Subversive Learning style.
