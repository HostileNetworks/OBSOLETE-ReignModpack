Grand Scheme
the Divine Ones
This world is not what you imagine it to be. You are but a pawn in the grand scheme of things, yet you still feel in power.
Look around you. Tell us what you see. Do you see a house yet? Do you own one? Or are you still living off the land, foraging for seeds and blocks, surviving by the skin on your teeth and eating rotten flesh for dinner? There are so many more things for you to accomplish before you can truly become a chosen one. That house, if existant, could be so much better than it is now. You could develop your fighting style. Kill a skeleton with a sword without getting hit once, even by blocking.
The only way you'll unlock your true potential is if you let go of all your fears and worries and jump into it. Release the worries of creepers blowing up your work. Do not fear a death by skeletons or zombies, and grab life by the throat demandingly. But even by discarding danger you'll still never be like us... Like the divines. When we first laid eyes upon you, you were a new arrival in our garden. You woke up in this world you knew nothing about and tried to take it for your own. You cut down trees and scarred the earth with tools ripped from the very fibers of the plants.
It was hard work indeed, and we were unsure of what you were attempting to accomplish. Were you a godsend, someone who would help restore the beauty of this world, rid it of the evils that corrupted it? Or were you only here to take and take, stripping resources from the rock and creating destruction? We were soon convinced otherwise when we saw your creations. Your beautiful, fantastic creations: perhaps there was hope after all for these lands. Maybe someone could actually save us from our imprisonment by what you refer to as 'the mobs', freeing the world once again, a lost paradise reclaimed. I'm as sure of anything that you would like to never have to fight another mob again, wouldn't you?
There's a way for this to become reality. Continue your constructions. Resume building wonderful things until there is no spot where one cannot see a mark of ingenuity. Houses, sculptures, rivers, windmills, bridges... anything that is pleasing to the eye. When these are completed, the mobs will trouble you no more. You will have become a true renaissance man, versed in all crafts and accomplished in everything you do. You will be battle hardened, an excellent fighter, but you will still be able to enjoy the peace and beauty of nature and your creations. Mobs will fall before your weapons in scores, and they will begin to realize there is no place for them here. After you've proven your worth by slaying a powerful mob such as the Wither or the Enderdragon, they will leave these lands forever, and the peaceful mobs will begin to respawn once more. There is one final step you must take before we can return. Build a statue of us. A monument to our glory, something both you and I can be proud of. Carve our visages into seperate statues, or make one incredible exclamation. Something that tells the world you're in control, you're in power, you're the best you can be. Only then will we return.

We look forward to seeing you, @c.player.nearest;.
