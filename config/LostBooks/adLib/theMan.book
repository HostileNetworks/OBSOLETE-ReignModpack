The Man
@c.noun.name;
I saw a man today. He was @adjective;, @verb.past;, and was holding #a; @noun;. I walked towards him to @adverb; @verb.infinitive; him, but he gave me #a; @adjective; look that @verb.past; me.
I @adverb; walked away, trying not to stare at his fairly @adjective; @noun.bodypart;. Unfortunately, he caught me.
"@c.exclaimation;!" I said, @adverb;. It was no use - the man quickly @verb.past; me as I tried to get away. It wasn't long before he ripped off my @noun.bodypart.plural;.
The moral of the story is: you need to learn how to write with your @noun.bodypart;. You never know when a similar @noun; could befall you, leaving you unable to write the story of how it happened.
