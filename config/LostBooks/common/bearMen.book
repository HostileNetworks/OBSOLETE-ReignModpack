The Thought
Dr. Cook
The thought of fighting bear-men on a rock at the bottom of the ocean makes me question humanity. Why would bear-men exist? You know there's got to be some foul-play in that.

There are two possibilities, neither of which bode well for the human race's moral standards. The obvious and more confusing of the two is cross-species mating, a guy impregnating a bear - how or why could that happen? The second, more plausible reason is genetic engineering, involving years of spending large amounts of money - probably tax dollars - and occupying great minds to create bears that are like humans. Would these great scientists not realize the psychological effects of such a monstrosity?

Now, there are some of the implications of bear-men just existing, but why would they be fighting, much less on a submerged rock at the bottom of the ocean? I doubt there would be some sort of air bubble over this rock, which means the bear-men are probably wearing individual scuba tanks. This is a frightful thought indeed, since it would mean that there's funding behind the bear-men. This all raises the final question: who in humanity would fund bear-man attacks?
