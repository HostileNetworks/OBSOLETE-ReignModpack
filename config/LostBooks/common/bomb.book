The Bomb
Stanley
"What? I was supposed to cut the black wire? Well, this is embarra--" §oBOOM!§r

The wrong wire was cut, I failed to disarm the bomb and it was laughing at me in a violent, fiery explosion. I was so red from ebarrassment that I looked like a steamed crab on fire. I had no idea what to say, so I just said, "Ahhhhhhh!" at the top of my lungs to break the awkward silence.

Flying through the air, I felt like such an idiot. If anyone else had survived the blast, they would probably be laughing at how ridiculously I was flung. When I finally could get my feet back on the ground, I felt broken; as if I had just been launched hundreds of feet in the air by an explosion and broke nearly every bone in my body on impact. I looked pretty stupid laying on the floor like a pile of spaghetti, so I cried just to distract people from my ridiculous position.

I will certainly be more careful when I defuse bombs in the future!
