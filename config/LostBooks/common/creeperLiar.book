Once there was a young boy named Steve. He lived in a small village within the vast world of Minecraftia. He was a boy who just loved to play tricks on the residents. One day, Steve went outside his little house and decided to yell "Creeper!" The townspeople rushed to the boy's assistance with their swords, only to see the scene of the boy lying on the floor flailing about and laughing. Everyone asked what was so funny. The boy said he tricked all of them. Frustrated and angry, the people returned to their jobs. The next day however, the boy was outside like he usually was, and he saw it. He saw the creeper. He yelled "Creeper!" but no one came to help. The boy tried to fight the creeper, but it was meaningless, for the creeper blew up before the boy could even land a hit on it. The townspeople heard the explosion and rushed to the site of it. All they saw was a large gaping hole within the ground...
