One Does Not Simply...
Winston the Wise
One does not simply like a dog. One must completely cherish the moments that have been held between the dog and its owner. It shows a true bond and shows a great feeling of companionship. It is what should be found within all animal-human relationships. Most dogs are special for they sustain much longevity in life and have their own unique way of acting. They always act in a happy-go-lucky way. One must seek their heart for these dogs for they are gifts bestowed upon to only the greatest pet owners.

One does not simply see a cat. For they are soft kitty warm kitty little ball of... nope.

One does not simply walk into the Nether.

One does not simply see love between two people. One must delve into the great depths of true love between two who love each other very much. Whether it be family love, romantic love, or love between friends, they all are loved. One cannot simply say they like someone without loving them. No matter how weird it sounds, it holds true within one's heart. They always love that person they say they like. Word choice or not, one cannot deny the true meaning of friendship. It is a need of emotion contained in all of us. Friendship is such a complex process even all of these words can't describe the full aspects of it. One must seek for themselves what their true meaning of friendship, compassion, and love.

One does not simply write such things. They take up so much time and effort to describe in full and complexity of what one chooses their topic to be. It takes much time and impromptu thinking to write one of these. Some can be really long. Thankfully, this one is short...

One does not simply say simply. Simply is a rhetorical question? How so? What is simple? Simple is such the subjective term. What seems complex to others may be simple to some. And simplicity can come in forms. It seriously depends between person to person. So really, simple is hard to give a proper definition. Where would simple be without complex? What would complex be without simple? It is a hard debated question of defining indeed, for it is all based on the mind.

One does not simply reply to the previous statement, for it is a futile attempt to over counter this. Although it can be done, it is highly improbable... NOT. Again, this is all impromptu writing... I don't know what I write in these.

One does not simply like an English teacher. For they teaches nonsensical forms of literature, half of which we won't even ever hear or see. It is utter nonsense. It is a slight waste of time. Then again, we learn to talk like this and learn the "one does not simply" phrases.

One does not simply start saying one does not simply. It puts a new way of explaining things in such complexity only some can understand. It is done by picking a simple topic and putting large and complex words into a paragraph.

One does not simply say I. I is a word that is needed to be capitalized so much when used alone. Yet many forget... why is that?
