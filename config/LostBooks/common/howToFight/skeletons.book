How to Fight: Skeletons
Stanley Lieber
Cleanly killing a skeleton generally requires the use of a bow and arrows. Melee combat will usually result in the player getting hit by at least one arrow before dispatching the skeleton. However, when using melee methods, it is recommended to circle around the skeleton in a decaying orbit by strafing left or right while moving forward. This is a good way to dodge the arrows while getting close enough to attack.
If ranged combat is not an option, it is possible to minimize damage by blocking with a sword. This strategy can be used effectively by blocking just before the skeleton shoots an arrow and rushing forward after the shot. Repeating this process even while the skeleton is in melee range will allow the player to kill the skeleton while taking as little damage as possible from its arrows.
As skeletons are not solid, it is also possible to back them into a corner and stand inside them, hitting them with the sword. The knockback will keep them in the corner, and they will fire arrows directly into the ground without harming the player. Do not forget to use certain corners and tight spaces to your advantage.
Going after skeletons while swimming is not advised, as the water will slow your movement down, making you an easy target for a skeleton's arrows. However, a risky but useful method of fighting while in water is to sink to the bottom of the water and move underneath the skeleton. This allows the player to attack without being attacked as easily by the skeleton. Remember that this only works when both you and the skeleton are in fairly deep water.
Skeletons, like zombies and zombie pigmen, can be damaged by splash potions of healing and also are damaged heavily by a sword with the Smite enchantment. Use these items to your advantage. Keep in mind that undead are also immune to poison and will be healed by splash potions of harm.
Some skeletons will pick up swords dropped on the ground. Be careful - the skeleton will no longer despawn and will gain the benefits of the attack damage and any enchantments on the sword. When the skeleton is killed, it will drop the sword with the same durability it picked it up with. Be warned, however, that you cannot rely on this method, as not all skeletons can pick up items - you might just be throwing a weapon on the floor!
When all else fails, turn to your trusty bucket of water and dump it between you and the skeleton. You will easily be able to make your escape if far enough away from the skeleton. If the skeleton is already close, then you will most likely be hit once or twice before you escape. Once in safety, you can get back to full health and devise a plot to kill the skeleton. Always be sure to keep your bucket handy and full of water!
