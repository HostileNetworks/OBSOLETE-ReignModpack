How to Fight: Spiders
Stanley Lieber
Because spiders can pounce and move almost as fast as the player when hunting at night or aggravated, they should never be underestimated. As the only naturally occurring source of string apart from dungeon chests and cobwebs in abandoned mine shafts, preparation and effort can pay off when hunting spiders. Wearing armor and carrying a stone or iron sword or bow is recommended. A bow is the preferred weapon, as arrows can damage a spider at a safe distance and spiders present a large and visible target due to their size and glowing eyes. When attacking a group of spiders, pick off the ones that aren't too close to others in order to avoid aggravating several at once. In a sword fight, it is best not to charge at a spider directly, but to retreat while attacking when it pounces to avoid getting hit.
Alternatively, the player can dig a narrow trench with a depth of two blocks in order to be able to attack spiders safely from underneath, trapping them above the gap. This strategy has mixed results, as some players have reported spiders waiting for them to exit the trench before pouncing, a behavior possibly caused by the AI that makes the spider lose track of the player after a number of unsuccessful attacks and therefore become neutral until the player is visible. Players should also keep in mind that trenches can leave them vulnerable to other mobs (skeletons, zombies, and especially creepers) in the vicinity.
When attacking or being attacked by spiders, prepared or unprepared, your first priority should be to have the high ground, or if that is not possible, to at least ensure the spider does not have the high ground. When on higher ground the player can continuously attack the spider, preventing it from jumping and avoiding the attack while also ensuring the spider does not have a clear jump on the player. If the spider has the high ground on a player, it is advisable that the player retreat to flat ground before engaging with the spider, due to the fact that if the spider has the high ground, it will be able to jump on the player's head with the extra height. This causes an almost unavoidable attack and thus causing unnecessary damage. A player can also attack the spider as it drops down on the player similar to fighting a slime. This can also be useful as it can easily do fall damage to the spider once it lands. The player can also use the spider's width to get out of difficult situations. If the ill-equipped player is being pursued by one or more spiders, it is best to hide behind a one block wide gap, so the spiders will be incapable of hitting the player. Be careful! The player must stand at least two blocks in the gap, as the spiders can attack at close range.
Spiders, like its relatives the cave spider and silverfish, are damaged more by swords with the Bane of Arthropods enchantment. Keep in mind that spiders and cave spiders are also immune to poison.
When all else fails, turn to your trusty bucket of water and dump it between you and the spider. You will easily be able to make your escape after punching it once. Once in safety, you can devise a plot to kill the spider or simply light up the area to make it neutral. Always be sure to keep your bucket handy and full of water!
