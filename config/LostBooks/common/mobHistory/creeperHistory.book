One day, a long time ago, Notch made creepers. He made them kind, and they often followed people around. The fact that they exploded if they got damaged caused many people to lure them into the forest away from buildings and kill them. For many moons, none of the creepers knew about the murders, because all that were left of them in the forest were craters. Eventually, though, the creepers would find out. In fact, sooner than the people thought...
It was a hot day in the desert. Steve and his buddies were trying to find a desert village to trade in. A creeper family of four lived in a hole blocking their path, and Steve decided to lead his friends into the cave. They didn't know about the creeper family and decided to kill them there, since there were no private places to do it nearby. Steve lashed out at the biggest one while his two buddies took on the second-biggest one. The smallest one jumped into the battle to defend his parents. While all this was happening, the last creeper fled his home crying. What he had just seen happen stayed with him forever. He grew a permanent scowl on his face. He told every creeper he met about the slaughter of his family, and they became angry too, and bore the scowls that are now trademarks of creepers. Soon, creepers had seen more and more murders of their kind in the woods, and all creepers wanted revenge. In a matter of years, every creeper in Minecraft wanted revenge on humans, and vice versa.
That is how you know creepers today.
