Seven Minutes
The Forgotten Sage
If you have ever been in a near-death experience, you may have seen your life "flash" before your eyes. I have asked several people about this. They said that it was like they went through their whole life in a second. That is not too far fetched. Your brain likes to avoid stress, so that it does not have to deal with facing death. So if your brain was to think you were going to die, it would go to the easiest way to escape: memory. So when it comes close to the end, your brain turns on every memory you ever had.
The brain will also stay alive for about seven minutes after you die, provided your brain is intact. So if you have seven minutes and you can experience your whole life in one second, that is sixty lives per minute. Four hundred and twenty lives in seven minutes. That is a lot of time and a lot of experiences with death.


How much time do you have left?
