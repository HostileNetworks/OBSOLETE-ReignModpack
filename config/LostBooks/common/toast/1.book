TOAST §71/5
Father Toast
§lT§r is for thickets, thoughts, and thud. T is for Mr. Tandy. He's the kind of sincere old gentleman that acts much younger than he is. His face looks like a white leather canvas with freckles like brown paint speckles flicked off an artist's brush. We often play around near the thickets, or he lets me run to town on my bicycle on all sorts of strange errands. Today started as any other, "Hey Tands, got anything for me to do?" I called over to Mr. Tandy. "Sure do," Mr. Tandy babbled, "got me here a top-secret letter here, I do. Lookin' fer a messenger, I was." Mr. Tandy smiled and slyly handed me a letter with a red wax seal inscribed with Tands' initials: "C.T." He told me to keep it "real safe-like"" and to give it to the postman in town. I ran off to get my dark, blue-gray bicycle. I liked it because it had flames on the front of it, as if I went so fast on it that I started to combust. I pedaled into town as fast as my thin legs could take me, making sure to keep Tands’ letter safe in my messenger bag. I kept my messenger bag full of what matters most on a trip- food and grape juice, with a side pocket to keep letters in. I looked down for a moment to make sure my cargo was still there, and when I looked back up, got smacked in the face by something hard, rough, and relatively wide. I lost my balance and began to wildly wobble; thoughts were racing through my head. §oWhat just smacked me? Who threw that at me? How am I going to live through this?§r I figured my best hope was that my plump bag acted like a pillow to cushion my fall. No such luck, it fell off my arm in the chaos. "At least I wore a helmet." I mumbled as I lost contact with the bicycle seat. §oThud!§r
