TOAST §72/5
Father Toast
§lO§r is for odd, orange, and oblong. I grudgingly dragged my eyes open, the world was a blur. My head was throbbing as I clumsily wobbled out of bed. I rubbed my eyes and noticed something odd. §oWasn't I just in town? How did I get here?§r My head was on fire, and I figured the best way to deal with it was to have a hearty breakfast, so I drowsily dressed myself and walked out to the dining room. Glorious smells of bacon and orange juice wafted past as I went to sit at the table. I began devouring the food like a ravenous bear, but I realized something more peculiar. §oWhere are my parents? How did this food get here?§r I suddenly felt like something drove a railroad spike into my head. A noise like screeching banshees split my head in two. The world around me began to warp and stretch out like an oblong, wavering tunnel.
