TOAST §73/5
Father Toast
§lA§r is for approached, anywhere, and always. I blinked a few times and snapped out of the din of confusion, only to find myself laying in a stark, white room with a lonely door and a single bed. I noticed Mr. Tandy standing beside me in a white tuxedo. "Looks like Sleeping Beauty finally woke up, she did," chuckled Mr. Tands. Tands explained to me that I had been sleeping for almost a week. "Where am I, anyways?" I wondered out loud. "You're free to go outside and see for yourself, you are," Mr. Tands responded. I arose from the ocean of white cloth and approached the lonely door. When I got closer I noticed it had the word "ANYWHERE" engraved upon its face. My hand hovered over the pale doorknob as if to test it for heat. I swiftly twisted the doorknob and slowly nudged the door open. I walked out and looked around; realizing that the lonely white door was no longer behind me, in its place stood a sign reading "Welcome to Always Land."
