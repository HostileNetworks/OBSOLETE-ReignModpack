TOAST §74/5
Father Toast
§lS§r is for skies, sweets, and situation. Gingerbread houses and twisting licorice roads with skies of smooth blue and cotton candy stretched out before me like a panorama of sweets. Golden toast people traversed the city roads with the sun glimmering overhead like a golden idol. A toast person moved towards me. He was toasted to golden brown perfection, buttered lavishly, and adorned with cinnamon and a red crystalline crown of sugar. In a low, commanding voice the toast person kindly greeted me and introduced himself as the Toast King. The Toast King escorted me through the crowded streets to his castle of candy and toured me around the royal residence. "So, my boy, have you ever been to Toastia City before?" the Toast King bellowed. "I've never been here before, are there other cities of talking bread people?" I asked. The Toast King stopped where he stood. "What did you just say, kid? Did you say 'bread people'?" grumbled the Toast King. "Uh, yeah... is something wrong?" I muttered. "Boy, you've got a LOT of nerve calling us bread people, and in the royal castle of all places!" boomed the Toast King. I tried to apologize, but I was so frightened all I could do was stutter. "GUARDS, get rid of this child!" called the Toast King. His voice was loud and booming, echoing across his castle. I bolted as fast as I could, frantically looking for an exit. I soon felt lost in a labyrinth of hallways and corridors, but with the royal guard hot on my trail, I had no choice but to keep running. After running down the serpentine hallways, I came to a dead end. The royal guard had cornered me, and I had nowhere left to run. The guards chuckled as they slowly closed in on me. I heard a bellowing laugh and the Toast King appeared from behind the guards. I sure seem to have gotten myself into an unpleasant situation. The Toast King slid a grubby hand across his throat. §oYep, I'm doomed.§r
