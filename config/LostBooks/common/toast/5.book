TOAST §75/5
Father Toast
§lT§r is for terror, twirl, and toast. Terror filled and consumed me from within. The Toast King had just given his guards the universal signal for 'kill.' However, just as the guards had raised their weapons to deliver the killing blow, they began to melt and twirl, like an artist mixing a batch of paints together, and faded out to white. My ears began to ring as my head collided with a rock. My head was throbbing as I warped back into reality. My entire body ached from the fall and consequential tumble into the shallow, rocky gully along the roadside. Dazed and confused, I saw the small square object rolling down the gully towards me, bouncing along as if it were laughing. §oThat dream must have happened in just a split second, but why was it about toast?§r I wondered, and then it hit me.
