Higgins' Journal §71/9
Higgins
Today, I was mining in a cave and, as usual, the spiders were being obnoxious. I was trying to mine ore and I kept on being attacked from both sides. Usually, they come from deep within the bowels of this huge cave, but it seems they were now coming from a small cut in the rock I hadn't seen going into the cave. Even stranger, there was a small light coming from inside this split.
As I cut the head off of the last spider in the onslaught of arachnids, I decided to move closer to the light. I only had a few peices of coal in my bag, and I figured I could stop the spiders if I destroyed
or blocked up where they were coming from. As I neared the split, I heard some very strange noises. They sounded like huge peices of fabric being hit by baseball bats, with an occasional screech of a spider penetrating the looping sound. I rounded the last corner and stood amazed and horrified by what was in front of me.
