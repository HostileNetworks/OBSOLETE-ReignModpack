Higgins' Journal §72/9
Higgins
There were humongous spider eggs all over the place - they were stuck on the walls, the ceiling, the floor... It was disgusting. Globs of what I can only guess to be past spider meals were splattered throughout, along with a few iron tools covered in the slime. A diamond pickaxe with the initials §0J.H.§r was very close to my location. I was about to take it, when I heard a tremendous splatter. I looked up; one of the eggs had fallen from the ceiling and split on the ground! Hundreds of spiders of all sizes were scattering from the broken husk, most were stumbling randomly, but others were headed right for me.
