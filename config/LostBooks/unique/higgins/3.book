Higgins' Journal §73/9
Higgins
The smaller ones followed the bigger ones, and the bigger ones were after me. I did what I could: I grabbed the pick and ran like hell. I almost fell on the way - that would have been certain death. I heard the screeches of hundreds of spiders behind me - it was a feeding frenzy and my panting was driving them wild with hunger. I risked a look behind me.
Big mistake. A spider was about three blocks behind me - its jaws were wet with saliva and its eyes were unusually bright, like a fire was burning behind its lenses. I unsheathed my sword and sliced at its head. I missed, and lost my balance.
I almost fell again, but luckily regained my balance. I decided just to run instead of attempting to fight the torrent of spiders. I made it into my small underground storage area and slammed the door behind me.
