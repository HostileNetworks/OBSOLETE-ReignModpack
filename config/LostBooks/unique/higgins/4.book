Higgins' Journal §74/9
Higgins
The door couldn't hold that many creatures for long; I had to hurry. I ran to my ladder and climbed as fast as my arms would take me. The door gave out behind me and they swarmed up the ladder in pursuit of their prey - me. Just as I was jumping out of the hole, a claw dug into my leather boot. Would not come out, though; it was day, and the light blinded them. Safe in the ladder holes shadows, however, they could still attack. I stabbed it in the head and breathed a sigh of relief as I heard the succesive thumps of spiders falling down the ladder shaft.
I turned to face a burning zombie behind me. The blade cut through the soft middle part of it, causing it to topple in half. Groaning, it laid there until I smashed its head in with my new-found pickaxe. I would be safe another day.
