Higgins' Journal §75/9

The next day, I went mining again. I was quick to block up the split in the wall, which for some reason
was no longer emitting light. I resumed my ventures through the cave, placing torches down. I wanted to light up the area before I tried harvesting any ores, in order to prevent more attacks.
I felt a cold chill and turned to my right. A dungeon was placed high up, beyond the reach of my pick and sword. I decided to place some ladders and climb up to it. I was excited to loot the chests. I placed the last ladder and walked into the dungeon's confines. A torch revealed what I wish I hadn't seen.
