Higgins' Journal §76/9
Higgins
In the middle of the room there sat a large iron cage, with a miniature zombie spinning inside of it. I had alerted the populace by placing the torch down, and 5 heads turned to look at me. From the farthest corner of the room came an odd noise. Before I could even think of what to do, a large shape burst from the edge of the room and rushed at me with frightening speed. Its eyes were red-rimmed, its head was split down the middle with teeth in each side. It smacked me in the jaw and I lost my balance, then fell. I tried to grab onto the ladder but it broke in my hand and I was sent downwards. Surely a fall like this would kill me, I thought to myself.
§oSplat!§r My fall was cushioned by a spider, I hit it in its abdomen and it split open all over the floor. It stank like death, but at least I was alive.
