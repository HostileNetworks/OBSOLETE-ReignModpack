Higgins' Journal §77/9
Higgins
I wasn't out of the woods yet, though. Er, cave. The undead from the dungeon were jumping down, wanting a taste of my flesh. The first one hit the ground with a splitting sound. Its legs broke off at the knee and it fell on its face. It started to drag itself towards me, but two zombies jumped on it from above and splattered it like the spider. I threw a torch at one of them, setting the monster on fire, but that didn't stop it. The second one I dispatched quickly, I cut off its arm and kicked it in the face. The heat from the burning zombie prevented me from getting within striking distance, so I retreated back the way I had come.
I looked behind me to see two more zombies jumping down. The burning zombie was slowing down, the fire working its way into its muscles and destroying them until it collapsed in a burning heap. I decided to finish off the other two zombies now that I could approach, when the split-head jumped down as well.
