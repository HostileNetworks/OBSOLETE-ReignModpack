Higgins' Journal §78/9
Higgins
The split-head grabbed the closest zombie and hurled it at me with suprising strength. I ducked and it hit the wall behind me, splattering into a disgusting mass of guts and blood. The split-head rammed into me just as I got up and knocked me backwards into the main area of the cave, where the blocked up spider nest was. I was in a great deal of pain, but I got up and looked behind me - the split-head was already getting ready to charge again. I looked him in the eye and prepared. He charged, but I had a plan.
Just before he got to me, I placed down two stone blocks in front of him. He tried to stop, but his momentum carried him into them and his head split open even more than it aready had. I pulled out my bow and arrow and shot the last zombie through its eye. As I walked over to the creatures' corpses, I noticed that the split-head had dropped something: a yellow ring of some sort. The ring appeared to glow slightly, as I reached down to grab it, but my arm was grabbed by a skeleton. I tried to punch it, but it dodged the punch by moving its head, and then attempted to return the blow. The skeleton's fist grazed my cheek, but its bony knuckles drew a slight amount of blood.
