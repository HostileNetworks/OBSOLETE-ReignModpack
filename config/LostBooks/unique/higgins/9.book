Higgins' Journal §79/9
Higgins
The ring was in my hand, and I stuck in my pocket so as to free up my hands for combat. The skeleton was much faster than any skeleton I'd seen before, and it swung its bow at me like a club. I'm positive that if the bow had hit me, I'd have been knocked out and eaten on the floor of the cave, but I managed to dodge it by purest chance. I thanked Notch for the good fortune, and kicked the bony abomination in its ribcage, which snapped two of its brittle ribs and knocked it backwards a good ways.
I felt an immense pain in my leg - something had bitten into it! The split-head which I had assumed dead, was not and had somehow managed to bite me with its parted dentures! Each side of the head peeled away from the brain like a gross, half-peeled orange, the brain beating with the unholy energy that kept the dead alive. I raised my leg to stomp on the remainder of its head and snuff it out of existance, but I started to slip on the slick blood and was forced to return my foot to the previous position, or else suffer a fall. More undead filtered in behind the split-head. There was a whole mengarie of generic flesh-eaters, but a couple stood out: one was missing its jaw, another was wrapped entirely in bandages like a dusty mummy from ages past, and yet another possessed a mouthful of razor sharp mandibles to tear flesh like paper.
The skeleton regained its balance and nocked an arrow: this further convinced me to abandon the cavern as soon as possible, so I left the split-head to its pathetic existence as I fled from the cave with my life - and the ring.
