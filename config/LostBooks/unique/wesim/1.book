Today in the mine, those blasted zombies kept coming after me! I should've taken more torches with me, but I just had to keep on mining. I was nearly done with my quota when I saw something sparkle in the darkness. I crept up to it and put my last torch down. It was a diamond! I took out my iron pickaxe and started mining my prize when, suddenly, it vanished! I glanced up and saw an endermen had snatched up the diamond ore right from under my pickaxe! I quickly looked down to avoid making eye contact and followed it, waiting for it to place the ore back down. I followed it deep into the darkness, so lured by the diamond that I had forgotten that I ran out of torches. Suddenly, I heard the squeals of many hungry spiders - a dungeon! I needed torches! I retreated and felt around for some coal and, with luck, found some. I quickly made a few torches and cut my way through the spiders to light up the dungeon. I looked around for the enderman holding my diamond, but I could not find him - he got away! Just when I was about to give up hope, I saw a little sparkle a way down the cavern. I ran towards it, making sure there weren't any endermen waiting to steal my diamond again, and quickly recovered the diamond from the stone! It was getting late, so I hastily made my way out of the mine and filled my quota with everything, except for the diamond - that one was for me.
