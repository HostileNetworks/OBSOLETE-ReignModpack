I woke up feeling sickly and tired today. I went to the infirmary and the physician said I had a high fever, so I will have to spend tonight in the infirmary.    Date: 1-27-1045
It looks like I'll have to spend another night in the infirmary. A day and night of rest didn't seem to do any good, and the doctors don't have any idea what is wrong with me.
