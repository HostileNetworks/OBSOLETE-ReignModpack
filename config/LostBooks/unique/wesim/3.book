I had a dream last night. I dreamt an enderman was standing in front of my bed, just staring down at me. Suddenly, I heard a loud roar and looked up to see the Ender Dragon! It turned to dive straight for me, so I reached to grab a nearby ender pearl to teleport out of the way, and I woke up, clutching an ender pearl. I have this creeping feeling about the 'dream', that maybe it wasn't a dream at all, but I know that the Ender Dragon was blocked from coming to our world long ago. Still, that doesn't explain where I got the pearl from. I told the physician about my dream, he said that of all the patients he had seen, none of them have ever had my kind of... thing. I'm not really sure what to make of that, other than I might not be getting out of the infirmary any time soon.
