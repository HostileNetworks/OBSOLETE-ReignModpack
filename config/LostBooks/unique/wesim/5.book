A group of mosters attacked the town last night. A few got inside the walls, but they didn't make it far. Also, I vomited up a strange purple liquid earlier today. Nobody knows what it could be, but I definitely haven't eaten anything with much color lately. The black spots on my skin are getting larger, and my physician doesn't know what they could be - he says the spots aren't cancerous, but I'm not sure how much hope that really gives me.
