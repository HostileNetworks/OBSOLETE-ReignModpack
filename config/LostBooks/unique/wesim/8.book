This night, I woke up feeling great! I have adjusted my sleep schedule sleep during the day and be awake at night, because my skin seemed to be getting more sensitive to light, and nobody was awake at night to look at me with their beady eyes. I don't know what it is, but I feel lively again and my stomach isn't churning. The black spots are still covering my skin and my feet hang off the bed, but otherwise, I think I might be getting better!
